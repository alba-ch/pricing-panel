## Background 
This project has been developed as a participation in the online challenge proposed by Jump2Digital, a digital event organized by Barcelona Digital Talent.

The different areas to choose challenge from are:
- Frontend
- Backend
- Data Science

I opted for the Frontend one, which consists of developing a pre-designed price panel with the preferred technology. I chose to make my own design and added animated transitions to it as an add-on.

## Roadmap and visuals
Check out how it looks on web!
