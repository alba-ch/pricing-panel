## Background 
This project has been developed to participate in the online challenge proposed by Jump2Digital, a digital event organized by Barcelona Digital Talent.

The different areas to choose challenge from are:
- Frontend
- Backend
- Data Science

I opted for the Frontend one, which consists of developing a pre-designed pricing panel using the preferred technology. I chose to make my own design and added animated transitions to it as an add-on.

## Roadmap and visuals
Check out how it looks on web!

## Technologies

### Languages
To develop the project, I have used:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

There are other technologies allowed, but I decided to stick with the basics since I haven't worked with the others yet.

### Software
To design the page I have used **Adobe XD**, as it gives you a lot of freedom in the creation of UX/UI components, allows you to create responsive mockups and it's the software that I'm most familiar with. The sample photos used are extracted from **Pexels**, a provider of photographs and stock material without copyright.

## Structure
Files in the repository:
- `/index.html` Structure of the pricing panel
- `/main.css` Includes all styles of the page
- `/res/bg.png` Background image of the page
- `/res/imcard-*.png` Sample image card.
